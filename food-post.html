      <h2 class="title">What do you prefer Pizza/Pasta?</h2>
      <p>Made at home with fresh and healthy ingredients in moderation, pasta has the potential to be healthier. As you may surmise, they are very similar: starchy and carby, topped with a sauce or cheese, many toppings from pizza can go into pasta, and both can be made as healthy or unhealthy as you want.</p>
      <p>My gut says pizza is more unhealthy in general, but pasta can be surprisingly unhealthy; both are when eaten in large portions, extra toppings, or greasy, fattening creams/fillers.  Both, eaten at a restaurant, can have similar, unhealthy nutritional profiles. Made at home with fresh and healthy ingredients in moderation, pasta has the potential to be healthier.

      <p>Giving the variety of combinations on both, the only underlying difference is noodle versus bread.  I'll leave that trade off dependent on your dietary focus. Whole wheat noodle has a better nutritional profile, containing copious minerals and nutrients, complex carbohydrates, less sodium, and no cholesterol. You can make wheat pizza dough, but it's less common.</p>
